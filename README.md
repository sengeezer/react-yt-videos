This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and based on content in Stephen Grider's excellent [React and Redux course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WcYA0QecllQRno=/) on [Udemy](https://udemy.com).

## Setup

Create a `.env` file containing your Youtube access credentials.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
